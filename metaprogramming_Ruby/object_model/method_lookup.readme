# This is how Ruby lookup the method 
# when sending a message(aka method) to an object
# 
# First, it lookup in obj itself whether Ruby can find the method or not
# Then to the obj's singleton_class(meta class)
# The Class of the object
# The module include inside the class of the object
# to the Class of the Class of the object
# repeated until BasicObject
#
# It is called "one step to the right, then up"
